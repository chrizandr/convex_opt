# convex_opt
This is a library for convex optimisation and related work that I did as part of a Convex Optimisation course.
All source code is free for all as always. Please use it if you can. Dependencies for the source are:
  * Python 2.7+/3.5+

  * Virtualenv (optional)

Create a virtual enviroment
```
virtualenv .convex_opt
```
Activate the environment
```
source .convex_opt/bin/activate
```
Install **cvxopt** and **cvxpy**
```
pip install cvxopt cvxpy
```

Enjoy :)
